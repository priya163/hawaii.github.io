    <h3 id="message"> The global mindset of Hawai'i as a paradise getaway is damaging to the environment, to the locals and to the culture. Overtourism is drowning the islands into detriment - it needs to be stopped. </h3>

    <h3> Overcrowding </h3>
    <br>
    <p> Hawai'i is a tourist hotspot, which has lead to a massive strain for locals as the government prioritises catering to tourist demands, over the needs of Kānaka Maoli (native Hawaiians). As large non-Hawaiian owned corporations flood the islands, competition in the entertainment and tourist sectors is too harsh for locals to start independent businesses. This leaves them with low-paying jobs from companies that exploit their lands and practices. Low wages, like these jobs offer, cannot sustain the high cost of living in Hawai'i, which is caused by inflation from tourism. </p>

    <h3> Cultural exploitation and erasure </h3>
    <br>
    <p> Turning hula, leis, luaus and more into 'exotic' aesthetics to consume on holiday contributes to the commodification of Hawaiian culture, and erases the meaning behind many practices to create profit for overseas companies. As if this isn't bad enough, sacred grounds are being disrespected and misused for the construction of hotels, shopping centres, golf courses and more.

    <h3> Tourist Behaviour </h3>
    <br>
    <p> Collective ignorance about Hawai'i is shown by the actions of tourists, like disturbing or touching protected wildlife, littering and visiting sacred lands. Because of the sheer amount of tourists every year, these actions build up to cause catastrophic consequences, like water pollution. During COVID, when tourism grinded to a halt, a visitor-free Hawai'i began showing signs of restoration. The landscapes of the islands were no longer crowded with people, and some fish and sea species were sighted returning to their natural habitats.  </p>
